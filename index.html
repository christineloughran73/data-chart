<p> About 27% of eligible voters ages 18-29 cast a ballot in the 2022 midterm elections, according to an early estimate from Tufts University’s Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE). This is the second-largest turnout rate for young voters in a midterm election ever, second only to 2018.</p> 

<p>Exit polls from the Edison Research National Election Pool also show young voters favoring Democrats 63-35% in the U.S. House of Representatives and playing a key role in states that had consequential Senate races, including Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Georgia.</p>

<p>Margaret Groarke, Ph.D., political science professor at Manhattan College in the Bronx, attributes the recent increases in voter turnout and favorability for Democratic candidates to several factors. For one, issues including climate change, the right to abortion and the economy were all on the ticket this year. So was the concept of democracy, with conspiracy theories and claims of election fraud that began in 2020.</p>

<p>“In 2018 I think a lot of young people saw Trump's agenda as a real threat. This year the big issues were inflation and maybe the economy more generally, abortion – the Dobbs [vs. Jackson Women's Health Organization] decision has broken that open as an issue this year in many states in a way that it wasn't in the past. In the Dobbs decision, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas pointed out that the same logic that overturned Roe vs. Wade should be used to reconsider same sex marriage and and some other issues. Young people feel some of these issues – namely abortion – more strongly than say, my generation.”</p>


<p>On top of the issues that were in focus this November, Groarke notes there is significant work happening at the college and university level to support students throughout their voting journey, and that has impacted voter turnout, too. For instance, nonprofits like the All In Democracy Challenge are partnering with schools nationwide to ensure students are registered to vote, understand how to request an absentee ballot, and make a voting plan. Voter engagement committees have been able to do this creatively, through traditional outreach methods like tabling, and also by utilizing social media, web, and digital apps.</p>
